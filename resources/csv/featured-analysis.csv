"Where Unions Fell: The Geography and Demography of Union Formation in the U.S.","Zachary Schaller","Despite a deepening literature on the how and why of union decline in the US, less is known about the who and where. This study introduces an expansive dataset on National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) representation elections that offers a novel perspective on the patterns and consequences of union decline. By leveraging newly available county disaggregation, I reveal a significant shift in the spatial distribution of elections, with rural areas experiencing a more pronounced decline compared to urban areas. A shift share decomposition shows that this result is not driven by urbanization or sectoral shifts. Instead, evidence suggests unions have strategically redirected efforts towards higher value targets in urban regions, leaving workers in rural areas isolated and more vulnerable to monopsony power. The study also explores demographic and economic factors associated with union organizing, shedding light on evolving trends since the 1970s.","https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CW8gxg1GuqAQUltWtf7sFmH8gdrGCOB4/view?usp=drive_link","./resources/images/featuredAnalysis/Where-Unions-Fell.png","A visual showing the number of elections per ten thousand workers over time, in both rural and urban counties. The rural trend begins around four elections per ten thousand workers, has a sharp drop after 1980, then gradualy decreases to slightly below one election per ten thousand. While the urban trend begins just under one election per ten thousand workers, and then gradually drops to under .5 elections per ten thousand workers."
"The Siren of the Labor Movement: Spillover Effects from Starbucks Organizing","Zachary Schaller, Sal McCollum, and Prasiddha Shakya","Since the first Starbucks store unionized in Buffalo in 2021, over 700 locations have filed for elections, and broader organizing has surged. We examine whether this campaign sparked wider labor activism. Using an event study, we find that counties with a Starbucks election saw nearly six additional non-Starbucks elections on averageâ€” accounting for 21% of the post-2021 surge. However, a staggered difference-in- differences design reveals no wage gains for restaurant workers, suggesting that union momentum has not yet shifted bargaining power. Employers may be waiting on the outcome of first contract negotiations before adjusting pay structures.","https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aBKi1D5hR7u3fdABiqw6WPZMKvfSS9zD/view?usp=sharing","./resources/images/featuredAnalysis/The-Siren-of-the-Labor-Movement.pdf","An event study graph showing no change to election spillover prior to the event, which in this case is a starbucks union election. It then shows an increase in election spillover after the event."
