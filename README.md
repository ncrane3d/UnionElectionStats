## Overview
Welcome to Union Election Stats, a user-friendly hub for data on National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) representation elections. Here you can explore the history of union organizing through interactive visualizations, learn about recent trends in the labor movement, and download data for your own bespoke analysis. The database was constructed by a team of academic economists/political scientists, Zachary Schaller, Sammy Young, and Jonne Kamphorst, and is based on NLRB records. It contains the known universe of representation elections from 1962 to 2024. Soon it will also track the most recent elections as cases close. Use the Downloads tab to access the database, check out the Featured Analysis tab to dive deeper into union scholarship, and use the Contact Us tab with any inquiries or bug reports.
